Seniment analysis using logistic regression

* The "sentiment" dataset consists of 3000 sentences which come from reviews on "imdb.com", 
"amazon.com", and "yelp.com". Each sentence is labeled according to whether it comes from a 
positive review or negative review.

* The data set consists of 3000 sentences, each labeled '1' (if it came from a positive review) or '0' (if it 
came from a negative review). To be consistent with our notation from lecture, we will change the 
negative review label to '-1'.

* We will use logistic regression to learn a classifier from this data
